And an edit in the third file.

Another change in third file before file is staged. 

Now I'm making some more changes after initial commit. 

And a change in the third file. 

Another change in third file after checking out to main.

Why do they call it a branch? Why not a bough?

Some say the world will end in fire.
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire

But if it had to perish twice, 
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
